      <h3>Welcome to Evercadia</h3>
      <p>
        The front page will contain my a photo of what I call my masterpiece, my book Evercadia.
        I will have a short paragraph giving the preface of Evercadia. To the right of the paragraph, will be a link to where 
        my readers can purchase a copy of my poems or Evercadia for themselves. I will also have a short (rotating) list and example of some of my short work poems.
        My purpose here would to define just a sliver of inspiration to leave them wanting more. If I can inspire them, then has my goal reached it's fruition.. If I am
        able to max a little extra income, then that's the icing on the cake.. My true end goal is inspire the minds of others. Photography is using the creative powers
        of a camera to captivate and uplift others through picture. It is also used when one needs to express a message when words won't suffice

      </ul>
      <h3>Poetry and the Nerdest book</h3>
      <p>
        The heart of all of my artwork, my written poetry and books. I love writing and hope to be able to find readers of all ages. From page 1 to the final page, I want to have them feel uplifted, even though 
        Evercadia is fantasy/ science fiction. I believe all (well written) books should leave you with a feeling of self that beems with positive energy.
        I tend to be a descriptive writter and love using imagery in my phrases and cues. Sometimes a photo is worth 1000 words, well I want to desrcibe those 1000 words 
        throgh poetry.
        Into the arms of your embrace
        The whisps cull the rivers without a trace.
        My suspicions
        Your feltered quell
        Ripples laugh
        Ravens guide along.
        Is it the dusty road that sings to her moon.
        Your reflection deep within the sound
        Shinning through dancing water upon the ground.
        Your heart
        it whispers
        your smile 
        light grows
        Seed flowers have begun to bloom
        The fabled crow, it hallows summer's gloom
        A friendly shape
        nothing to escape
        Light shinning unto the gate
        Friendship eternal, our land a fruitful landscape.
      </p>

        <p2> I would also include a snipit from Evercadia as well as a detailed preface
          Free-spirited and eccentric, Zene is a young man who puts his faith of his fate in the roll of his trusty dice. With the flick of a wrist, destiny is determined. Serving as captain of the grand airship Namaste, Zene and his dice guide he and his quirky crew on a journey to retrieve the fabled Spirit Chasm; a talisman said to bring prosperity to those who claim it. Not long into their adventures, mysterious elements begin to take an interest in the travelers and steer their fate through trials, tribulations, and forces. Some found within the world they know, while other entities hail from a veiled realm, unseen to their mortal eyes. Will the roll of the dice steer their destiny to fortune, or will Zene's luck finally run out?

      <h3>Photograohy</h3>
      <p>
        I love photography! it symbolizes everything that is beautiful in this world. From sunsets to landscapes, to the unknowing shadow. Everthing possesses beauty in this world and 
        I desire to bring it out. Sunsets upon the water are my favorite. I have a special love for black and white photos. It brings out the image in such a way as to give it a whole
        different feel altogether. I also enjoy adding light textures to paintings or pictures I already own, to give them a completly different spin on them.
