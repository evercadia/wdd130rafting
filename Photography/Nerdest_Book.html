        <p>Free-spirited and eccentric, Zene is a young man who puts his faith of his fate in the roll of his trusty dice. </p>
        <p>With the flick of a wrist, destiny is determined. Serving as captain of the grand airship Namaste, Zene and his dice </p>
        <p> guide he and his quirky crew on a journey to retrieve the fabled Spirit Chasm; a talisman said to bring prosperity </p>
        <p>to those who claim it. Not long into their adventures, mysterious elements begin to take an interest in the travelers  </p>
        <p>and steer their fate through trials, tribulations, and forces. Some found within the world they know, while other </p>
        <p>entities hail from a veiled realm, unseen to their mortal eyes. Will the roll of the dice steer their destiny to fortune, </p>
        <p>or will Zene's luck finally run out?</p>

       <p>I love to write Poetry, I feel its one of the best ways that I am able to connect with people</p>
       <p>To be able to share a part of yourself that you yourself didn't know even existed is very inspiring to me. </p>
       <p>I feel inspiration is a small seed that is within us all, I love to help spark that inspiration to help cultivate it</p>
       <p>into something greater, something deeper, something so small yet profound, that it can help shape their lives.</p>

        <h1>A proud viking were the rivers three  </h1>
        <h1>We crossed the stars to reach the world tree  </h1>
        <h1>Yggdrasil lay at the heart of lightning and snow  </h1>
        <h1>Truth I found, faint with a shimmering glow  </h1>
        <h1>I spiraled the winds till my wolfe met I   </h1>
        <h1>Together we forged with a sun-drawn eye   </h1>
        <h1>His love proved the forge to my sail   </h1>
        <h1>We voyaged the dawn through land, magma, and even the hail   </h1>
        <h1>Other spirits I bestowed upon our safe haven  </h1>
        <h1>One part wolfe, one part raven   </h1>
        <h1>Ancestor spirits call me now to another land   </h1>
        <h1>Our canversations we never had   </h1>
        <h1>but I gave to you a son, s spirit, a lad   </h1>
        <h1>Only a temporary momeny have I parted  </h1>
        <h1>Flyn will know where to seek, back to where we started  </h1>
        <h1>A heart of wisdon  </h1>
        <h1>A heart of gold  </h1>
        <h1>A heart of spirit  </h1>
        <h1>A heart so bold  </h1>
        <h1>We shall meet again, for I am Marigold  </h1>
