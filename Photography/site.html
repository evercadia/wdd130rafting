      <h2>My Blog</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My purpose here is to introduce myself to an array of readers and to open up their imaginations. I love taking photography and using light to enhance its properties</p>  <!-- change this -->
      <p> Some people paint the world with colors and black ink, I paint the world with words. I want to spark the life of imagination and creating a blog will help me accomplish this.  </p>  
      <p> Pictures can help create feelings when words aren't able to express them properly. I want to help people express their deep feelings through my photography. </p>
